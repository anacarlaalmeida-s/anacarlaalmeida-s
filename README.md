### Hi there 👋

I am recent pedagogic graduate and beginner in this developers' world . I started with very luck, as a student of Cubos Academy.
In soon these repositories will be full, I hope and I'll work for this.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about JS, CSS and HTML, with focus in front-end and back-end.
- 🤝 I'm looking to learn all that I can.
